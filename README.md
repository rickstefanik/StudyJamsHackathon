StudyJam is a tool that draws upon the well-researched topic that putting a phrase to music helps people remember things better.  The StudyJam website takes text from user, sends this text to our CherryPy Melodizer API, and returns a songified version of the text that can be played in the browser or downloaded.  The CherryPy Melodizer API we wrote calls upon the IBM Watson text-to-speech API in a unique way, such that each word spoken is a different tone in the same key.  After getting this audio from IBM Watson, our Melodizer API also adds a muscial backing track to the audio.

Consider studying for a test.  One could put facts they need to remember into StudyJam, and listen to the songs generated to help him or her memorize the text.
